It is done with Angular 8 with a Back end for front end server done in Nodejs. This is the only component of the solution that is not using publishing events. You will learn how to do test driven development with Angular, and the BFF pattern in action.\n</PageDescription>\n\nThis project is part of the Container shipment reference implementation as presented in this [project](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc).\n\n\n## User stories to support\n\nThis project is in light development so the following user stories are in plan (or done):\n\n- As a fleet manager I want to login to the webapp to access the fleet management feature. Use eddie@email.com.\n- As a fleet manager I want to select one of the fleet to get the list of ships with their attributes in a table format, and plot the ship on a map at their respective position (latitude, longitude)\n- As a demoer I want to start ship movement so the ships move on the map\n- As a fleet manager I want to select one ship from the table of ships and present a detail view of it with its containers loaded in the boat\n- As a demoer I want to start the fire to container or heat wave or container down simulation from the detailed ship view\n- As a demoer I want to see the message coming back from the streaming analytics about next best action from my simulation\n- As a manufacturer manager I want to enter container shipment order information like product reference, quantity,  pickup from address, earliest pickup date, shipment to address,  shipment by date, and required temperature in transit range so the shipping company can give me back an order confirmation ( including the orderID), expected pickup and delivery dates, the assigned voyage and ship name as the microservice will not have a dedicated UI, we are using the demonstration UI to define the forms to gather the data. So this user story is implemented in the kc-ui project, and in this microservice we need to offer the create and update operations and get by order ID\n- As a manufacturer manager I want to read the status of an order given its order id and receive a report with the full event history of related order, voyage ship and container events.\nThe order id is generated by the order create operation, and is immutable. An order is assigned to a voyage at the time it is created.\n\n\n## UI Development\n\nThis is a traditional Angular 7 app with the app.module.ts using `shared` and `features` modules. `Shared` is for UI generic widgets, while `features` are for supporting the UI specific components linked to the business logic.\nThere is no login page yet, but the home page displays a set of tiles to support the demonstration of the full shipment process as illustrated in the figure below:\n\n![kc-ui](kc-ui.png)\n\nFor the BFF code the server code is under the `server` folder and uses the standard patterns for expressjs middleware. The [readme file](./server/README.md) goes into the details on this implementation.\n\nThis project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1. The user interface features are under the features folder. We are using a TDD approach as described in [this note.](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-caseportal-app/blob/master/docs/tdd.md) The tests run with `ng test`. We also encourage to read the [angular.io testing guide](https://angular.io/guide/testing)\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nAs this implementation solution is part of the Event Driven architeture reference architecture, the [contribution policies](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) apply the same way here.\n\n**Contributors:**\n\n* [Jerome Boyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromeboyer/)\n* [Hemankita Perabathini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemankita-perabathini/)\n\nPlease [contact me](mailto:boyerje@us.ibm.com) for any questions.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"954ed6486f1cb799100477f405e0b9ab","counter":61,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"User Interface for the K-Container shipment solution","description":"User Interface for the K-Container shipment solution"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: User Interface for the K-Container shipment solution\ndescription: User Interface for the K-Container shipment solution\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\nThis repository includes the user interface to support the demonstration of the end to end Reefer containe shipment process.
